 A clock-weather station project based on ESP32 with an e-paper display, powered by a battery and controlled by an accelerometer
</h2>

My goal was to implement a clock with a timer function that can be started by changing the position of the device. By changing the position of the clock, you can set a timer for a certain duration, as well as get detailed information about the weather. The device is also controlled using a joystick. The joystick provides access to informative screens and enables fine-tuning of the timer time and starting the server for remote setup. Using the settings web page, it is possible to set the necessary data for the connection, time zone offset and the required number of alarms for each day of the week.
