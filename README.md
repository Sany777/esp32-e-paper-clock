 A clock-weather station project based on ESP32 with an e-paper display, powered by a battery and controlled by an accelerometer
</h2>

The aim was to implement a clock with a timer function that can be triggered by changing the device's position. By adjusting the clock's position, you can set the timer for a certain period and also open pages with weather information. The joystick expands control capabilities, allowing access to informative screens and precise timer adjustments. The display shows the time, indoor temperature and humidity, as well as the outdoor temperature and the chance of rain
