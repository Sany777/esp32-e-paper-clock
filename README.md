 A clock-weather station project based on ESP32 with an e-paper display, powered by a battery and controlled by an accelerometer
</h2>

My goal was to implement a clock with a timer function that can be adjusted by changing the position of the device. The device is controlled using an accelerometer and a joystick. By changing the position of the clock, you can set a timer for a certain duration, as well as get detailed information about the weather. The joystick provides access to informative screens and allows you to fine-tune the timer time
